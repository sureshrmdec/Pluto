 * 
 * Build BST
 * 
 * reverse a string. how many ways you can solve this problem. 
 * 
 * String replace(String originalString, String pattern, String replacement)
 * 
 * List Interface
 * 
 * Write a method implementing a given interface to merge two streams of numbers
 * 
 * Scramble an array with an equal change for every value. 
 * Return a list of all permutations of an array
 * 
 * int to roman, and vice versa
 * 
 * Implement a shooting algorithm for the game of Battleship.
 * 
 * create a minimal spanning tree.
 * 
 * Implement a RPN calculator in Java
 * Given an interface called IntStream with methods 'bool hasNext()' and 'int next()', 
 * implement the function 'IntStream merge(IntStream[] streams)' 
 * where each input IntStream produces strictly increasing, possibly infinite number of, 
 * integers, and the resultant IntStream also produces strictly increasing integers 
 * by merging the input streams. 
 * The interviewer also provides a simple test harness that prints the first 5000 integers from that function.
 * 
 * Design data structure to implement T9 dictionary/
 * 
 * median of an infinite stream of integers in O(1) time. 
 * 
 * Multi Threading Lock Question. ie Bounded Queue
 * How do you search thrgough huge flatfile?
 * 
 * how do you make n threads run at the same time
 * 
 * Do a depth first traversal of a Rose Tree (the data-structure) and print out each element 
 * 
 * Implement a concurrent read-write buffer.
 * 
 * How do we tune the applications servers in case of high load
 * Which algorithm will you use for sorting an array and why? 
 * 
 * determine if a graph is bipartite
 * 
 * Two cooperative threads, how do you make one thread yield until certain condition is met.
 * 
 * thread safe on unit test code.
