/**
 * Given a list of integers and a window size, return a new list of integers where each integer is the sum 
 * of all integers in the kth window of the input list. The kth window of the input list is the integers from index
 * k to index k + window size -1 (inclusive).
 * 
 * For example,[4,2,73,11,-5] and the window size 2 should return [6,75,84,6]. For another example.[4,2,73,11,-5] and
 * window size 3 should return [79, 86, 79].
 * 
 * You may use the JDK or the standard template library. The solution will be evaluated on correctness, 
 * runtime complexity (big-O), and adherence to coding best practices. A complete answer will include the following:
 * 1.Document your assumptions
 * 2.Explain your approach and how you intend to solve the problem
 * 3.Provide code comments where applicable
 * 4.Explain the big-O run time complexity of your solution. Justify your answer.
 * 5.Identify any additional data structures you used and justify why you used them.
 * 6.Only provide your best answer to each part of the question.class TestResult
