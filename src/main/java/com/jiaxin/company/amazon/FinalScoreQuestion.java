/**
 * Given a list of test results (each with a test date, Student ID, and the student’s Score), return the Final Score 
 * for each student. A student’s Final Score is calculated as the average of his/her 5 highest test scores.
 * You can assume each student has at least 5 test scores.
 * You may use the JDK or the standard template library. The solution will be evaluated on correctness, 
 * runtime complexity (big-O), and adherence to coding best practices. A complete answer will include the following:
 * 1.Document your assumptions
 * 2.Explain your approach and how you intend to solve the problem
 * 3.Provide code comments where applicable
 * 4.Explain the big-O run time complexity of your solution. Justify your answer.
 * 5.Identify any additional data structures you used and justify why you used them.
 * 6.Only provide your best answer to each part of the question.class TestResult
