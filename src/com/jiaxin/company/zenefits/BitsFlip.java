 * Give a array of 0 and 1s, you can flip one sub range of the array,
 * determine the maximal value of array after the flip. e.g given [0, 0, 0],
 * the best range to flip is 0~2 and maximal value would be 3
 * [0, 1, 0], you can flip the first one, or the last one, or all the three(but
 * can't just flip the first and last one as the range has to be continuous),
 * and the maximal value would be 2
